A simple webapp that pulls statistics from Docker Hub every night. After deploying, you get a page like [this](https://export-to-ghostfolio-stats.vercel.app/).

Currently it stores the `pull_count` and `star_count` for each date. Please note that the app cannot get historical data from Docker Hub. It will create its own history from the first time the cron job runs.
 
## Tech stack

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) for the webapp/api
- [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) for hosting the app and the PostgreSQL database
